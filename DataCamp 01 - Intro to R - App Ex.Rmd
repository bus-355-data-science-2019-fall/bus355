```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

```

This exercise practices creating and comparing ordered factors

Create a ordered factor for the grades:
C, B, B, C, A, D, B, C, B, A, A, B

```{r echo=FALSE}
vector_of_student_grades <- c("C","B","B","C","A","D","B","C","B","A","A","B")
summary(vector_of_student_grades)
glimpse(vector_of_student_grades)

```
